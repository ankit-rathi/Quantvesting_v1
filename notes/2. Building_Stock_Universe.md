# Building Stock Universe

This session covered **foundational principles for selecting businesses and companies**, emphasizing the necessary qualitative criteria, quantitative financial filters, and the crucial role of personal discipline and a growth mindset.

## 1. Learning Methodology and Revision

To fully absorb the material and make it part of the subconscious mind, students who achieve high marks (95%+ or 98%+) typically **cover their syllabus three to four times**.

- Single readings are insufficient.

---

## 2. Company Grouping and Definition

The session introduced three groups of companies based on size and the strategies that apply to them:

| Group | Composition (Size) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **X40** | Large Cap and Mid Cap |
| **X40 Next** | Mid Cap and Small Cap |
| **X200** | Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap |

The total list comprises about **250 companies** across these groups, which are the focus for applying the strategies.

**Market Capitalization Definitions (SEBI Guidelines):**
- **Market Capitalization:** The value of the company if all its shares were purchased at the current price.
- **Large Cap:** Largest 100 companies.
- **Mid Cap:** Companies ranked 101 to 250.
- **Small Cap:** Companies ranked 251 onwards.

## 3. Qualitative Conditions for X40 and X40 Next Selection

The best companies are filtered using **six specific conditions**, in addition to being in a growing sector.
All these conditions must be met (“and,” not “or”).

| Condition | Explanation and Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Debt-Free Company** | Should ideally be debt-free or have very low debt. Reduces risk of **bankruptcy** and **management fraud**, proving that management can run a profitable business. Some companies (like TCS) may carry temporary debt for operational efficiency. |
| **2. Market Leader in Its Sector** | The largest company in a growing sector benefits most. Market leaders influence policymakers, wholesalers, and customers. |
| **3. In Business for 15–20 Years** | Longevity shows adaptability to changing technologies, trends, and governments—proof of business acumen and maturity. |
| **4. Pricing Power (Brand Value)** | Ability to increase product prices without losing customers (e.g., Colgate, BMW, Apple). Lack of brand value (e.g., steel or commodity firms) makes pricing power weak. |
| **5. Future Growth Prospect** | Operates in a sector with immense future potential, gauged by **per capita consumption in India vs developed nations**. India’s lower income base offers growth headroom. |
| **6. Not a Government Company** | PSUs focus on **nation service** and balancing social goals—not profit maximization. Hence, not ideal for aggressive compounding. |

## 4. Market Insights and Risk Mitigation

- **Small Cap Myth:** Avoiding small caps entirely is wrong. Wealth is built in **market leaders within their sectors**, regardless of size.
  - *Example:* Bajaj Finance and Titan were small/micro-caps before becoming giants.

- **Liquidity and Listing:**
  - Avoid companies **listed only on the BSE**.
  - Over 50% of such companies are **operator-driven**, showing poor promoter attitude toward minority shareholders and liquidity.

## 5. Quantitative Financial Filters (X200 List)

For non-banking companies, apply these quantitative filters:

1. **Debt to Equity (D/E):** Less than **0.25 (25%)** → Healthy balance sheet.
2. **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE):** More than **20%** → Capable and efficient management.
3. **Net Profit:** Above **₹200 Crore** → Indicates scale and management integrity (due to high tax outflows).

**Exceptions for Banks/NBFCs:**
Because their business model is lending money, apply these instead:

1. **Return on Equity (ROE):** More than **10%**.
2. **Net Profit:** More than **₹1000 Crore**.

> *Example:* Out of 12 banks, only 8 met these criteria; out of 526 NBFCs, only 22 qualified.

## 6. The Superiority of Trading (with Investment Principles)

The session suggested that **swing trading on quality companies** can yield **higher returns** than long-term investing — *if* done with discipline.

- Even the best long-term investments (e.g., HDFC Bank, Asian Paints) rarely exceed **20% CAGR** over a decade.
- Disciplined trading strategies can achieve **30–40% CAGR**.

### Example of Compounding Impact:
| Scenario | CAGR | Corpus after 20 years (₹1 Cr start) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Investment** | 20% | ₹38 Cr |
| **Trading (Disciplined)** | 30% | ₹190 Cr |

### SIP Example:
- ₹20,000/month at 30% CAGR over 25 years → **₹135 Cr**

---

## 7. Discipline, Mindset, and Time Management

Achieving exceptional returns requires consistent improvement of the **mind**, **body**, and **discipline**.

### Key Principles:
- **Avoid Excess Internet Use:**
  Social media and endless scrolling destroy focus and thinking power — like an addiction.

- **Prioritize Health:**
  The body is your *only true friend*.
  Practice **daily yoga or exercise** for at least one hour to maintain energy and clarity.

- **Cultivate Positivity:**
  Stay humble, grateful, and avoid negativity. Seek blessings; they multiply success.

- **Manage Time Wisely:**
  Success starts with **knowing exactly what you’ll do in the next one hour**.
  Mornings often decide productivity for the rest of the day.

- **Continuous Learning:**
  Repetition builds mastery.
  Rewatch educational material (like *Satsangs*) and validate facts using reliable sources (e.g., **Google, company filings**), not TV tips or media hype.
