## Automating the Framework

This session suggests how we can build a framework to enter and exit stocks from your universe and automate it.

From your **universe of high-quality and robust businesses**, you can identify two types of stocks:

1. **Portfolio Stocks** â€“ the ones you already own.  
2. **Prospects** â€“ the ones that are not in your portfolio but are part of your stock universe.

By bringing together all the **fundamental** and **technical metrics** for every stock in your universe, you can easily:

- **Filter prospects** based on your criteria or strategies.  
- **Identify new opportunities** to invest or trade.

Once you take positions, you can **continuously track your portfolio** to see if any stock meets the **exit conditions**.  
When a stock nears its **target or exit criteria**, you can **rotate your funds** into new opportunities that meet your **entry conditions**.

This process of **fund rotation** helps maximize returns while staying disciplined, which can be automated using any programming language (python).

Iâ€™ll explain these **rotational strategies** step-by-step later.

> ðŸ§  Note:  
> - **Smart traders** use these rotation and exit strategies actively.  
> - **Smart investors**, on the other hand, can keep investing based on entry criteria and need not worry much about rotation or exit rules.
