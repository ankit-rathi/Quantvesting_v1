# Quantvesting Strategies (Simplified)
---
This session covers Quanvesting strategies for smart investors and traders:

## 1. For Smart Investors  

If you’re an investor who prefers steady, long-term growth:  

- Create your own list of **high-quality companies** — businesses with strong financials, good management, and consistent performance.  
- Every month, invest regularly (like a **SIP**) — but only in the stocks from your list that are **temporarily undervalued**.  
- You can identify undervalued stocks using two simple checks:  
  - **200-Day Moving Average (200 DMA):**  
    A long-term price trend line.  
    - If the stock price is **below this line**, it usually means it’s cheaper than usual.  
  - **RSI-14 (Relative Strength Index):**  
    A measure of how overbought or oversold a stock is.  
    - If RSI is **around 30**, it often means the stock is **oversold** (temporarily out of favor) and could be a good buying opportunity.  
- As a rule, **don’t invest more than 5% of your total portfolio in a single stock**. This keeps your risk under control.  

**In short:**  
Buy great companies when they’re temporarily cheap, and build your portfolio gradually and safely.

## 2. For Smart Traders  

If you prefer active trading and quicker gains:  

- Stick to your **universe of high-quality stocks** — focus only on strong, trustworthy companies.  
- **Buy** when:  
  - The stock’s price falls **below its 200-day moving average**, and  
  - The **RSI-14 touches 30**, showing it’s oversold and likely due for a bounce.  
- **Sell** when the stock **returns to its all-time high (ATH)** — the highest price it has ever reached.

- We assume that since it’s a high-quality, fundamentally strong business, its stock price will eventually recover and reach its all-time high again.
- As a rule, **don’t trade more than 5% of your total portfolio in a single stock**. This keeps your risk under control.  

**In short:**  
Buy strong stocks when they’re temporarily beaten down, and sell them when they recover to their previous peaks.
