Why should you try do-it-yourself (DIY) investing?

You may be hearing quite often why should you simply SIP in MFs and leave your corpus in the hands of professionals, but as a DIY investor, here are my counter-points:
- Better Transparency & Control
- Lower Costs, Higher Compounding
- Freedom from Herd Behavior
- Customizable to Your Goals
- No Dependency on Star Fund Managers
- Skill Building = Lifetime Asset
- Aligned with Long-Term Wealth Creation
