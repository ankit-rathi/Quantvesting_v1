## 🏅 Top Five Industries to Watch (2025–27)

1. **Renewable Energy & Green Hydrogen** – policy rocket fuel plus secular demand.  
2. **Specialty Chemicals** – China+1 and high ROCE offer structural upside.  
3. **Capital Goods & Defence** – capex pipeline translating into earnings leverage.  
4. **Information Technology** – asset-light, cash-rich, poised to monetise AI services.  
5. **Banking & Financials** – cleaned balance sheets, accelerating credit, attractive valuations.

*(Pharma and FMCG remain solid defensives but may deliver steadier, moderate returns.)*

## 💡 Investor Takeaway

> “Macro tailwinds, supportive policy, and solid capital efficiency are converging in renewables, specialty chemicals, cap-goods, IT, and banking. Keep valuations and execution risks in view, but these five sectors look best-placed to compound over the next 2–3 years.”
